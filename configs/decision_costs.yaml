# Decision costs are the core of defensible model selection.
# Costs can be defined per "use_case". Use-cases reflect business contexts.
#
# Binary classification convention:
#  - predicted positive vs negative at threshold t
#  - costs: TP, TN, FP, FN
#
# Costs are arbitrary units, but must reflect relative impact.
